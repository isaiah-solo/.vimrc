# My Vim Configuration
This repository contains my vim configuration for my personal machines

# Plugins
I use Vundle to install plugins. I include many specific plugins to improve my daily development. Some of these are:

1. NerdTree - For an easier view of project structures
2. ctrlp.vim - For a regex-based search of nearby files

# Built-in Features
In addition to plugins, I also default certain modes to ON. Some of these are:

1. set number - To allow me to see line numbers as I develop
2. set relativenumber - Shows relative line numbers for easier use with D and Y hotkeys
